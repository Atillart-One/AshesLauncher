# AshesLauncher
A launcher for the Dark Souls III mod Champion's Ashes, made by atillart#4807.  


## Instructions
To use, simply extract into a folder and run AshesLauncher4.exe.

If you have an existing launcher installation of Champion's Ashes, move the contents of the 'AshesLauncher/Ashes' folder to 'mods/Champion's Ashes'. The default directory for the 'mods' folder is in the same folder as the launcher, however this can changed by the user by clicking the MOD tab in the launcher.

To utilize other mods when not playing Champion's Ashes, simply put the mod in a folder inside the folder called 'mods'. The new folder should contain all the dll, ini, txt etc. files and folders needed.  


## IMPORTANT NOTE
This mod WILL ban you if you have it enabled and launch the game.   
Make sure it's disabled before using an account that you don't want banned.
