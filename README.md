# AshesLauncher
A launcher for the Dark Souls III mod Champion's Ashes, made by atillart#4807.  


## Instructions
To use, simply extract into a folder and run AshesLauncher4.exe.  
If you have a manual installation without launcher support, delete the Ashes folder inside the AshesLauncher folder from your Game folder, or select another mod directory.   
If you receive any error while trying to launch the mod from a manual install, try pressing "Reset All Files" present under the MODS tab first. It may take a while and the launcher will be unresponsive during that time.

## Using Other Mods
To utilize other mods when not playing Champion's Ashes, simply put the mods in their own folders inside the AshesLauncher folder (can be changed by selecting mods path in MODS tab.)    
The mod folders should contain all the dll, ini, txt etc. files and folders needed. The mods can then be chosen in the MODS tab in the launcher.  

Convergence example:

These files are all present in a folder named "The Convergence" (can be named anything) inside the mods folder.

## Switching Accounts
To switch accounts, open the included settings.ini in your launcher folder and change enabled = False to enabled = True.
Under usernames, follow the instructions to add your accounts.

## Additional Notes
The Champion's Ashes mod WILL ban you if you used on the official servers. The official Champion's Ashes private server can be enabled through the launcher.  
If you need to disable installing/updating Champion's Ashes, simply delete the Git folder in the files folder present in the launcher folder.  
Storing mods outside the Game folder requires the launcher to be run with Administrator privileges. Simply right click AshesLauncher4.exe and select run as admin.  
Private server joiner can be updated by replacing the file 'ChampionsAshesServerJoiner.dll' present in the files folder.
