# AshesLauncher
A launcher for the Dark Souls III mod Champion's Ashes, made by atillart#4807.  


## Instructions
To use, simply extract into a folder and run AshesLauncher4.exe.  
If you have an older non-launcher manual install, delete the Ashes folder inside the AshesLauncher folder from your Game folder.  

## Using Other Mods
To utilize other mods when not playing Champion's Ashes, simply put the mods in their own folders inside the AshesLauncher folder (can be changed by selecting mods path in MODS tab.)    
The mod folders should contain all the dll, ini, txt etc. files and folders needed. The mods can then be chosen in the MODS tab in the launcher.  

Convergence example:

These files are all present in a folder named "The Convergence" (can be named anything) inside the mods folder.

## Additional Notes
The Champion's Ashes mod WILL ban you if you have it enabled and launch the game. Make sure it's disabled before using an account that you don't want banned.  
If you need to disable installing/updating Champion's Ashes, simply delete the Git folder in the files folder present in the launcher folder.  
Storing mods outside the Game folder requires the launcher to be run with Administrator privileges. Simply right click AshesLauncher4.exe and select run as admin.
